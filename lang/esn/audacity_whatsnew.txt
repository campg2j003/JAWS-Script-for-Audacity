(This file last updated 9/14/2013)
. The URL for the JAWS User's Guide is now read from the config file.  It can't be edited from within the script, but it can be updated with a text editor.
. Version 2.0.4 of Audacity assigns keys Control+[ aod Control+] to Go to Start/End of Selection.  Therefore, we have changed the keys for reading the selection start and end positions to ALT+[ and ALT+].
. While playing/recording when ENTER pauses, Control+ENTER sends ENTER.
. Added Vietnamese README file (translation by Nguyen Hoang Giang).
. Added an Insert+ key assignment for each JAWSKey key.  This makes the script easier to use on laptops.
. Changed script AudacityHotkeyHelp to AudacityScriptKeyHelp.  This name more clearly represents what it does, and it removes a bogus additional entry in Keyboard Manager that was the result of a case mismatch.
. For Audacity V2.0.3 or later the special processing for the Import Uncompressed Audio Files warning dialog, the special processing is not used since the interface has been fixed.
. For slider controls in diaalogs that have associated edit boxes, the value of the edit control is now spoken when the slider changes while focus is on the slider.  These sliders are now named with the name of the edit control, and some of the extra chatter that occurred when these sliders gain focus has been eliminated.
. Paste now works in Audacity dialogs.
. The link to the Audacity JAWS guide in Audacity hotkey help is now an active link that opens the web page in the default browser.  The URL is read from the JSI file.
. Changed script Enter to perform the default enter script in the user buffer.  This causes links to be run by the ENTER key.
. Changed so that Audacity hotkey help does not display a link to default JAWS hotkey help.
. Added JAWS option EnterPause to control whether ENTER pauses during play/record.
. If the installer cannot read the location of the JAWS program folder from the registry it now supplies a default.  If it cannot find a folder at %programfiles%\Freedom Scientific\JAWS it looks for one in %programfiles64% (actually the value of the NSIS variable $programfiles64), and uses that as the fallback.
. In jfw.nsh added documentation for JAWSALLOWALLUSERS.  
. In jfw.nsh added documentation that if JAWSALLOWALLUSERS is undefined and the installer changes the shell context, it must also change the value of JAWSSHELLCONTEXT acordingly.
. In jfw.nsh if JAWSALLOWALLUSERS is undefined, on the install confirmation page, the message indicating whether installing to the current or all users read "for in".  Changed PageInstConfirmPre to not test JAWSALLOWALLUSERS.  Since JAWSSHELLCONTEXT defaults to "current", "the current user" is written if JAWSALLOWALLUSERS is undefined.
. In jfw.nsh commented out debug message indicating that only 1 JAWS version is installed and the JAWS versions page is being skipped.

New in JAWS scripts for Audacity version 2.0 (1/22/2013):

. Adjust JAWS Options (JAWSKey+v) now contains a section for Audacity options.  It currently contains two options: Announce Messages, which duplicates the CTRL+` key, and Announce Toolbars, which controls the announcement of the toolbar name when focus moves from one toolbar to another.  There is support for the older AdjustJawsVerbosity script, but it has not been tested.
. Added JAWSKey+v to the jkm file so that options will appear on JAWS 13, which has a new options facility.
. Fixed speaking of position fields.  Previously, .012s was spoken as 12s.  Now speaks time fields containing two zeros as one 0, so 01h00m00.015s is spoken as 1h0m0.015s.  This is not yet done for formats such as ##h##m##s+##frames.  The "days" format is now supported.  The code for this function has been rewritten to use more message constants, so it hopefully will be localizable.
. The extension of the Audacity script settings file has changed from .Ini to .jsi to conform to the JAWS scripting convention.  You can rename your existing audacity.Ini file to audacity.jsi and it should work.  
. In the settings file changed key announce to announceMessage.  Script ResetConfig now deletes the old (announce) key if it exists.
. JAWS no longer says "track table" when moving between tracks.
. JAWS speaks main window areas: Toolbars, Track Panel, and Selection Bar, as focus moves between them.
. JAWS speaks the toolbar name when focus moves from one toolbar to another.
. When focus is in the toolbars pressing CTRL+TAB and Shift+CTRL+TAB move to the first control on the next toolbar and the last control on the previous toolbar, respectively.
. JAWSKey+Delete speaks the current program state: stop, play, play pause, record, or record pause.
. left/right arrow keys Speak cursor position when Audacity is stopped.
. Keystrokes that extend or contract the selection speak the new position when Focus is in the track panel.
. Functions that use values from the selection bar now speak a message or silently omit the action requiring the value if the selection bar is not enabled.
. Track gain and pan controls now only function when the PC cursor is active.  Otherwise they execute their default mouse movement functions.
. HandleCustomWindows now calls HandleCustomWindows so that this function in scripts "use"d by this script will be executed.
. In many VST plug-ins, keystrokes move focus to the Presets control and activate Save/Load Presets.  Hotkey help is available for these keys in these dialogs.
. In many plug-in dialogs control names and values are now spoken.  Use JAWSKey+TAB to repeat the current control name/value.
. Added script SayJump and key assignments that bind it to comma, period, Shift+comma, and Shift+period.
. Added SelectAll announcement.
. JAWS now indicates when no project is open (no tracks in track panel) for many operations.
. JAWS now speaks an alert message when performing an operation which requires that the current track be selected but it is not.  Added this funtionality to the folowing scripts: JAWSDelete, DeleteSelectedAudio, MoveToStartOfSelectedTracks, SelectToBeginning, SelectToEnd, copy, and cut.
. Scripts CloseFocusTrack, DeleteSelectedAudio, JAWSHome, JAWSEnd, Copy, and Cut speak an error message indicating that they are not valid when Audacity is not stopped.
. The CTRL+JAWSKey+v keystroke now performs its default function, and then speaks the current Audacity script version.  When pressed twice quickly, it displays this information in the virtual viewer.
. The following now pass keys to the app when in a dialog or menu: scripts MoveToStartOfSelectedTracks, MoveToEndOfSelectedTracks, SelectToBeginning, SelectToEnd, SaySelectionStart, SaySelectionEnd, SayAudacityState, DeleteSelectedAudio, JAWSDelete, and Copy, and Functions SaySelectionPosition, and SayNoTrackSelected.
. Changed the conditions for not executing the default script in Start/FinishMarkerLeft/Right and made them perform their default scripts instead of silently sending their keys through.
. [ and ] can now be used in file name dialogs.
. Function AnnounceMessage now returns in open dialogs.
. JAWS now correctly speaks controls in the warning dialog shown when importing uncompressed Audio files.  This is done by new function IsWarningDialog and changes to function HandleCustomWindows and script SayLine.  Removed old implementation in script AudacitySayFrame because it works on Cuong's PC only.
. In the Edit Chains dialog F6 toggles between the Chains and Chain list views.  If the focus is not on the Chains list view, the key moves focus to the Chains list view.  
. In SayLine added tests for IsPCCursor and not UserBufferIsActive.
. When playing and recording, the ENTER key executes pause.  (It sends ENTER when stopped and "p" when playing or recording.)  I like this because the numpad ENTER key is easier to find than "p" if your hands are off the keyboard.  Try it out and let us know if you like it.

Issues:
. We have had problems getting the state of Play, Pause, Record, and Stop on some configurations.  In function GetAudacityState there is commented out code to determine the pressed state of toolbar buttons by testing the button graphic name.  There are also CS_IMG constants for the pressed state of the Play, Pause, and Record buttons that must be uncommented as well.  If the current code doesn't work for you, this might work.  This code needs further work, so if you need this code please let us know.
. The position fields sometimes are not shortened.  This happens because the JAWS GetWindowText function returns just the numbers with no h, m, :, etc.  We do not know what causes this.  I have been able to correct this by shutting down and restarting Audacity-- or JAWS, I can't find my notes on this.  This was observed with JAWS 10.
. A side effect of ENTER pausing during record and play is that you can't select/unselect tracks while playing or recording.  Also, if you redefine the numpad ENTER key and set JAWS to treat extended keys separately, both ENTER keys will be mapped to the typing keys ENTER.  If you don't like this feature you can deactivate it by adding a semicolon on the lines for ENTER and NumPadEnter in audacity.jkm and removing semicolons on the lines containing /* and */ before and after script Enter in audacity.jss.  
. The script does not recognize when editing a label in a label track.  Arrow keys continue to report the position and DEL/BACKSPACE report deleting audio.  If entering a label while playing, ENTER will pause rather than completing the label.  Does CTRL+m work while recording?

New in Jaws scripts for Audacity version 1.1 (8/10/2012):

. added alert message for the following default Audacity hotkeys:
+ Close (Delete) focused track  (Shift + C)
+ Deselect all the tracks (and any time-range)  (Ctrl + Shift + A)
+ Move to start of tracks (time zero)  (Home)
+ Move to end of all audio  (End)
+ Move to start or end of audio in selected tracks ( J or K)
+ Selection start at start of tracks (Shift + Home)
+ Selection end at end of all the audio  Shift + End
+ Selection start or end at playback position ([ or ])
+ Move the end of the selection to the right by a small amount  (Shift + Right Arrow)
+ Move the end of the selection to the left by a small amount  (Ctrl + Shift + Left Arrow)
+ Move the start of the selection to the right by a small amount  (Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow)
+ Move the start of the selection to the left by a small amount  (Shift + Left Arrow)
+ Delete selected audio (Delete, Ctrl+k, Backspace)
+ Cut, copy selected audio (Ctrl+x, Ctrl+c)
You can toggle these alerts on or off by pressing Ctrl+`
. Jaws now speaks the radio buttons in the warning dialog that appears when importing uncompressed audio files.
. Added scripts for adjusting gain and pan. These scripts replace mouse movement scripts (MouseUp, MouseLeft, etc.), but you can use the original functions by activating theJaws cursor. This feature suggested by Gary Campbell - the original author ofthe script.
. Added hotkey to toggle mute Jaws synthersiser (Insert+shift+s).
Added function autoStartEvent (just a little tip to indicate that the script is active).
Created dictionary file for some mispronounced words.
The Audacity hotkey help (JAWSKey+h) now displays hotkeys as links.
Created installer package (using Nullsoft scriptable install system).
Fixed error in installer (fix by Gary Campbell):
In DisplayJawsList now only counts JAWS version registry keys whose names start with a digit.  This rejects keys like "Common".
